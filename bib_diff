 \section{Method}
 
+\subsection{Potentials \& Potential Geometry}
+
+As in Carissan and Drujon \cite{drujon_pseudopotentials_2013}, we take a CH\(_{3}\) as our starting system. In order to fulfil the criteria specified in [REF: INTRODUCTION HAMILTONIAN], we make use of two kinds of Gaussian pseudopotentials [REF], of \(s\) and \(p\) orbital shapes. The \(p\) pseudo-potential is added after we conclude that a system of only \(s\) potentials is unable to represent the real system with the desired accuracy.

+\label{figure:ref_pseudo_diagram}
+\end{figure}
+
+Figure \ref{figure:ref_pseudo_diagram} displays the final pseudo-system. A hydrogen-like "pseudo-carbon", with a nuclear charge of \(Z_{nucleus} = 1\), and one electron occupying the \(p_{z}\) orbital, is surrounded by three potential sets at a planar distance of \(d\), each consisting of two \(s\)-shaped potentials with a distance above and below the \(xy\)-plane of \(c\). A further \(p\)-shaped potential is applied directly to the pseudo-carbon.
+
+This gives multiple variables we can use to manipulate the properties of the system. We can alter the strength and diffuseness of the \(p\) and \(s\) potentials themselves, as well as vary the distances \(d\) and \(c\) by moving the \(s\)-potentials. In this article we fix \(c = 0.25\).
+
 \subsection{Making Potentials Physically Meaningful}
+\label{section:potential_derivation}
 
-So far the method used to obtain the potential parameters has been strictly empirical. We reasoned however that we should be able to make an informed guess at some starting parameters from which to optimise. Clearly the assumption that \(Z = 1\) is unrealistic. The Slater rules suggest that, with the screening effect, the \(p_{z}\) electron should experience a charge of \(Z \approx 2.4\). To mimic the effect of an electron-screened nucleus, we can use a \(p_{z}\) pseudopotential. In order to make an educated guess of the parameters of this new potential, we needed to find an expression for \(Z(\langle r \rangle)\), \( \langle r \rangle \) being the expected distance of the electron from the nucleus. a value we can calculate for orbitals using turbomole parameters.

+Next, we need to find a value for \( \langle r \rangle \), which we can extract from our Turbomole calculation by calculating

-Now we have \( \langle r \rangle \approx 1.7\) and therefore we can see from (3) that \(Z_{eff} \approx 2.9\). However, the next complication is that this method assumes a complete overlap of the \(p_{z}\) orbital with the \(p_{z}\) pseudopotential which - given that the potential consists only of a single function as compared to the orbital's many - is unlikely to be the case. Therefore we define an overlap matrix \(S\) between \(MO\), the molecular orbital, and \(\chi\), taken from our pseudopotential definition

 \subsection{Computational Details}
 
-Here summarised are details of the methods used in calculation. All Hartree-Fock, DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) energy calculations are performed with TURBOMOLE 7.1. The basis set used throughout is the default def-SV(P). Wherever possible, planar (C\(_{S}\)) symmetry is used.The convergence energy is left at the defaults of \(10^{-7}\) (\texttt{\$scfconv = 7}) for SCF and \(10^{-6}\) for DFT. Geometry optimisations are performed with \texttt{jobex}. All other settings are left as default unless otherwise specified.

Also used are TD-DFT calculations, where the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (CIS) \cite{tammdancoff} is switched on to avoid triplet instability.
 
 \subsubsection{Optimisation}
 
 In earlier calculations with only \(s\)-potentials, optimisation was performed by choosing a range of exponent values and attempting to optimise the coefficient at each to produce the HOMO reference energy. Once the \(p_{z}\) potential was added, the \(s\)-potentials were optimised afterward. 
 
-Once we started to look at excitation and ionisation energies however, optimisation became more complicated. Optimisations were at first performed of the s and p-potentials to reach the HOMO energy of ethene as before. With the different potential variables available, we produced a range of optimised potential sets. The best set of these potentials was then chosen and the values altered by hand in order to match as closely as possible three separate reference values: the singlet HOMO energy, the singlet-triplet \(\pi-\pi*\) excitation energy, and the first ionisation energy. All optimisations used the Brent method in SciPy's optimisation library, and used standard Hartree-Fock calculations.

The pseudo-system is then set up, erasing the hydrogen atoms, setting the carbon charge \(Z_{nucleus} = 1\) and applying \(s\) pseudo-potentials, as well as selecting the correct orbital for the remaining electron. Table \ref{table:ch3_s_potentials} displays some of our results, with the \(s\)-potentials optimised to generate the correct HOMO energy.

-Next, we take some of these potentials to create a pseudo-ethene system, with the results shown in Table \ref{table:ethene_s_pseudo}. All potentials tested with \(r = 2.0\) gave results several orders of magnitude away from the reference value. From Figure [LONG R PSEUDO ETHENE PICTURE] we may see the reason. One of the potential sets from each carbon is closer to the neighbouring carbon than the neighbour's own potential sets, thus . At the shorter range \(r = 0.5\), the HOMO energy is of the right magnitude, though with errors of \(~ 30\%\). Attempts to eliminate this error lead us to the use of the \(p_{z}\) potential.

-Our next step adds a \(p\)-shaped potential centred on the pseudo-carbon along the \(z\)-axis, with Table \ref{table:ch3_p_potentials} displaying the results. The \(p_{z}\) potential is selected using the proceedure described above [SECTION REFERENCE], with the exponent chosen to give the maximum possible overlap with the \(p_{z}\) orbital, and the matching \(Z_{eff}\) coefficient calculated from the exponent and overlap. The \(s\)-potentials are then optimised once more to give the correct HOMO energy for CH\(_{3}\). We again take these potentials to create a pseudo-ethene molecule, with the results shown in Table \ref{table:ethene_p_potentials}. We can see that these potentials seem to transfer more effectively from the CH\(_{3}\) system to the ethene, suggesting therefore that whilst the \(s\)-potentials can affect both the \(p_{z}\) and \(\pi\) orbitals, they cannot alone represent the relationship between them.

The \(p_{z}\) potential is selected using the proceedure described in Section \ref{section:potential_derivation}, with the exponent chosen to give the maximum possible overlap with the \(p_{z}\) orbital, and the matching \(Z_{eff}\) coefficient calculated from the exponent and overlap. The \(s\)-potentials are then optimised once more to give the correct HOMO energy for CH\(_{3}\). We again take these potentials to create a pseudo-ethene molecule, with the results shown in Table \ref{table:ethene_p_potentials}. We can see that these potentials seem to transfer more effectively from the CH\(_{3}\) system to the ethene, suggesting therefore that whilst the \(s\)-potentials can affect both the \(p_{z}\) and \(\pi\) orbitals, they cannot alone represent the relationship between them.

-Having successfully created the pseudo-ethene with the correct HOMO, our next task is to have our pseudo-system represent other properties of the real one. Reference values for the singlet-triplet \(\pi-\pi*\) excitation and first ionisation energies of ethene are given in Table \ref{table:ref_ethene_exitation_energies}. Testing the relevant energies for our pseudo-systems, the early results are not promising, as we can see from Table \ref{table:early_ethene_excitations}. However, after we abandon the notion of sticking strictly to a \(p_{z}\)-potential exponent that gives the maximum overlap with the real orbital, we discover there is a "sweet spot" of potential coefficients and exponents around which the correct values begin to emerge. We speculate in section \ref{section:po_overlap} as to the reason for this. Table [PUT THE TABLE IN ALEX] shows our optimal result, chosen to give HOMO, excitation and ionisation energies closest to the reference values from Table \ref{table:ref_ethene_exitation_energies}.

In each case, the geometry of the reference system was optimised according to the method used (HF, DFT with TPSS, etc), before taking the the reference geometry and applying the pseudo-potentials in Table [PUT THE TABLE IN ALEX], optimised for ethene under HF. Figures \ref{fig:alkenes_hf_dft} and \ref{fig:alkenes_tddft} show the results. Table \ref{table:alkene_errors} gives a breakdown of the percentage errors for each method across all molecules tested. The pattern of increasing HOMO energy and decreasing ionisation and excitation energies seen in the reference systems seems to be well replicated by the pseudo-alkenes, with the energies following the same gradient.
