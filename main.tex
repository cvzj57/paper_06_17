\begin{abstract}
A pseudo-potential system for recreating an sp\(^{2}\) carbon atom is built and tested as a building block for various pseudo-hydrocarbon chain and ring systems.  
This pseudo-system has a central charge of $Z=1$, thus it contains only one electron. It is employed in \textsl{ab-initio} calculations in which several physical characterstics including first ionisation and excitation energies, as well as the HOMO energy, are found to be well-reproduced by the pseudo-system.

\section*{\sffamily \Large INTRODUCTION}

[NOTES

The whole introduction is currently framed by talking about QM/MM. If we want to avoid saying our potentials are specifically a QM/MM solution then we need to re-write it. I suggest opening with a bigger overview of pseudo-potential uses before zeroing in on ECP methods instead, and from there leading to our research.

Uses of pseudopotentials:

plane-wave stuff for condensed matter

ECPs and RECPs

QM/MM

treatment of dispersion errors

]

Another common use of pseudo-potential methods are in ECPs, where the replacement of core electrons in heavy atoms with relativistic effective core potentials (RECPs) permits calculations on molecules involving such atoms to be more efficient. 
	This is not to say, however, that pseudo-potentials have been employed only in the treatment of heavy atoms. There have been efforts to make use of potentials for use on some light atoms, such those of Topiol \emph{et al.} or Gresh and Pullman, who MNMMN. These methods were aimed at reducing computation time for calculations performed on 1970s-era computers on what were then considered large molecules to simulate. However, since then the growth of computing power available to chemists has been easily rivalled by the need for chemists to simulated larger and more complicated molecules. 

We propose taking the pseudo-potential concept to a new extreme. Our goal is to investigate the feasibility of pseudo-potentials designed not only to replace the core electrons of light atoms, which is itself unusual, but also to replace specific valence electrons that don't take part in the electronic behaviour in which we are interested.

It is a common idea that a chemical system can be thought of as comprised of (at least) 
two parts:
an active one, where most of the chemistry takes place, and an inactive
one, both of which must be taken into account in order to fulfil chemical requirements.
Based on this general statement, many successful theoretical approaches have been developed.
Among them can be cited QM/QM' or QM/MM methods, where 
the active region that usually contains several atoms is
treated at a high level of calculation, while the inactive part is treated at a 
lower level of theory, allowing for increased computational efficiency at a minimal cost in accuracy.\cite{chung_oniom_2015,

 Fragmentation methods split the complete problem into smaller parts and combine individual calculations
on these fragments to recover the properties of the overall system.\cite{gordon_effective_2001,steinmann_effective_2012}
Frozen density embedding techniques replace part of a molecule, or 
its surroundings,
by a frozen electronic density extracted on a reference system.\cite{wesolowski_frozen-density_2015}
They are an extension of the frozen core approximation, already used to reduce
the number of parameters to be optimised in the self consistent field calculation.
In the context of this work, the pioneering efforts of Rivail \emph{et al.} must be mentioned, in which the total wavefunction is optimised with some molecular orbitals kept frozen.\cite{ASSFELD1996100}.


The problem of treating the QM/MM boundary is well-known and several groups of methods have been developed to try to resolve it. The most common method involves substituting the boundary atoms by Hydrogen capping atoms. However, another approach is to use pseudo-potential atoms. Among the earliest were Zhang \emph{et al.} \cite{zhang_pseudobond_1998}, who created pseudo-carbon atoms with 7 valence electrons, and an ECP designed to reproduce geometric characteristics of bonds between Carbon and other atoms. There have also been the ``Quantum Capping Potentials" (QCPs) of Dilabio \emph{et al.} \cite{dilabio_simple_2002}, in which they began by taking a pseudo-carbon with four electrons, pushing three into the core by means of an ECP, and adding shielding and Pauli repulsion terms in order to reproduce the Mulliken charges of a methyl group. More recently, in 2011, Ihrig \emph{et al.} \cite{ihrig_specific_2011} had been working on refining the QCP method via stochastic algorithms for use with biomolecular groups, with a view to preserving the electronic density of QM fragments in QM/MM calculations.

 The underlying theory used in many of these methods was set out by Huzinaga in 1991 \cite{huzinaga_effective_1991}. In this paper he emphasised that the 'dormant' electrons of the inactive region had three main effects upon the active electrons, which any pseudo-potentials should maintain; these were the Coulomb and exchange forces, as well as a 'no-collapse' term.

Following his proposal, for an atom where active and dormant electrons have been separated, the Hamiltonian reads:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:atomicHamiltonian}
\hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{h}(i) +\sum_{i<j}\frac{1}{r_{ij}}
\end{equation}
with $\frac{1}{r_{ij}}$ the bi-electronic interaction
between explicitly treated active electrons and
the mono-electronic operator:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:monoElectronicOperator}
\hat{h}(i) = -\frac{1}{2}\Delta_i - \frac{(Z-Z_c)}{r_i}+\hat{V}(i) + \hat{\sigma}(i)
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_i$ is the Laplacian of the coordinates of electron $i$, and 
$Z_C$ is the number of core electrons withdrawn from the reference system.
The operator $\hat{\sigma}(i)$ is the 'no-collapse' term that prevents active electrons
collapsing into the dormant region. The operator $\hat{V}(i)$ reproduces the 
Coulomb and exchange interactions, for which Huzinaga proposed a spectral formulation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HuzinagaMPVersion1Potential}
\hat{V} = r^{-n}\left[\sum_IA_I\exp(-\alpha_I r^2)+\sum_JB_Jr\exp(-\beta_J r^2)\right] \text{with}\;n=1
\end{equation}
To take into account the fact that dormant electrons are removed from the
system, the nuclear charge is modified by the $Z_c$ value.
Yet, as the effective charge felt by the active electrons is likely not to be an integer,
the modification of the value of the nuclear charge is scaled in $\hat{V}$.
In this operator we notice that the \(r^{-1}\) behavior is mantained for the first term 
(the Coulomb one).
%

In this article, we performed the active/inactive split on a molecule with $\pi$ electrons: the $\sigma$ electrons comprising the inactive part and the $\pi$ electrons the active part.
The Schr\"odinger equation was solved for the later part only in the field of the dormant part.
The aim is to propose a methodology for extracting a potential for a hybridised carbon atom (here an $sp^2$ carbon atom), which can then be used as a building block for constructing chemical systems. This carbon pseudo-atom contains but one explicit nuclear charge and one electron.
Moreover, the method should be usable ``out of the box", in any standard quantum chemistry software.
Thus, no modification of the source code should be done.
This supplementary constraint is fulfilled by strategically positioning the pseudo-potentials.
We aim to reproduce basic properties of the electronic structure of the sp$^2$ carbon in a molecular framework (HOMO energy, ionisation potential and excitation energies).

%Pseudo-potentials for hybridised carbon
%atoms have been already successfully extracted in a previous work of ours.\cite{drujon_pseudopotentials_2013}
%There, our attention was focused on the 'no-collapse' term, and 
%functions in the pseudo-potential shift up unwanted orbitals and correctly place the energy of the
%wanted orbitals.
%However, some pseudo-potentials had to be put precisely at the center
%of each bond.
%Thus, those pseudo-potentials could not be considered as atomic as they were not defined solely
%with respect to the position of the atom they applied to. The previous work should therefore be regarded as a proof-of-concept.
%In this new version, we include more physical meaning in our model, 
%by placing pseudo-potentials that mimic Coulomb interactions among both the active and dormant electrons, and the shielded nuclear charge. 
%The new pseudo-potentials are fully atomic: the position of the atom
%determines completely where the potentials are placed in space in the best possible manner
%when dealing with hybridised atoms (as hybridisation destroys isotropy, the preferred orientations
%must be given to define the pseudo-potential).

difference from the HALOGENES

This article is structured as follows.
In the first part, the method is defined in detail.
The second part shows the results obtained using the most refined version of the method. The extracted pseudo-potentials are then employed for extended systems, with results and discussion. A final perspective is presented in the conclusion.

\section*{\sffamily \Large METHODOLOGY}

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Pseudo-potential definition}

As in our previous work\cite{drujon_pseudopotentials_2013},
we take CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) as our starting system to be reproduced.
It is the smallest system containing one and only one sp$^2$ hybridised carbon atom. This choice allows us to isolate the different electrostatic interactions to build a physically meaningful model. We make use of two kinds of Gaussian pseudo-potentials \cite{me_structure_theory}, of \(s\) and \(p\) shapes. As we want to avoid modifying the quantum chemistry software itself, the pseudo-potentials have a semi-local form and we choose a value of \(n = 1\) to preserve the \(r^{-1}\) behaviour as in Huzinaga's work.
The multi-centered pseudo-potentials that we build read as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ourPP}
\hat{W} = r^{-n}\left[%
\underbrace{\sum_IA_I\exp(-\alpha_I r^2)\sum_m\left|Y_{1,m}\right>\left<Y_{1,m}\right|}_{\text{p projectors}}%
+%
\underbrace{\sum_JC_Jr\exp(-\gamma_J (r-r^0_J)^2)\left|Y_{0,0}\right>\left<Y_{0,0}\right|}_{\text{s projectors}}%
\right]
\end{equation}
with $Y_{0,0}$ the $s$ spherical harmonic, $Y_{1,m}$ the $p$ spherical harmonics and $r^0_J$ the relative fixed position of the $J^{th}$ potential with respect to the origin of the pseudo-atom, which carries the pseudo-potentials.
By analogy with Huzinaga model potentials defined in (\ref{eq:HuzinagaMPVersion1Potential})
we can say that the $p$ projectors aim to mimic a coulombic interaction,
while the $s$ potentials have the task of recovering part of the bi-electronic interaction
between the dormant and the active electrons, explaining their position \textit{around} the pseudo-atom.
Thus, this second term is not stricly equivalent to Huzinaga's $B_J$ terms as they aim at recovering
the bi-electronic interactions and the no-collapse term.
This later role was devoted to the $\hat{\sigma}$ operator in Huzinaga's formulation.

As discussed in the following sections,
the \(p\) pseudo-potential allows us to reproduce atomic properties, while the \(s\)-potentials mimic electrostatic electron pair repulsion.
The pseudo-potentials are mono-electronic operators, thus they shall not be able to reproduce fully bi-electronic interactions.
Knowing this, we adjust the parameters of the \(s\)-potentials for the pseudo-system to have a wavefunction in which properties such as spatial extent, energy and excitation energies are as close as possible to those of the reference system.

Figure \ref{figure:ref_pseudo_diagram} displays the final pseudo-system: The CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) radical has been replaced by a hydrogen-like ``pseudo-carbon", with a nuclear charge of \(Z_{nucleus} = 1\), and one electron occupying the \(p_{z}\) orbital. 
There are now no H atoms, and the system is surrounded by three potential sets at a planar distance of \(d\), each consisting of 
two \(s\)-shaped potentials with a distance above and below the \(xy\)-plane of \(c\). A further \(p\)-shaped potential is applied
directly to the pseudo-carbon.

This gives multiple variables we can use to manipulate the properties of the system.
We can alter the strength and diffuseness of the \(p\) and \(s\) potentials themselves,
as well as vary the distances \(d\) and \(c\) by moving the \(s\)-potentials.
In this article, we fix \(c = 0.25\;a.u.\).

\section*{\sffamily \Large RESULTS, DEVELOPMENT AND DISCUSSION}

In the following subsections, the following steps are detailed: extraction of a guess pseudo-potential
for the CH$_3^\bullet$ system, extraction of the complete set of parameters on the ethylene molecule,
application on different larger hydrcarbons.

\subsubsection*{\sffamily \large Obtaining a guess for a minimal pseudo-potential} \label{minimalpotguess}

It is possible to obtain the potential parameters entirely by empirical means, in principle. However, we felt we ought to be able to make a more informed guess at some starting parameters from which to optimise. Clearly the assumption that \(Z = 1\) is unrealistic. Slater's Rules\cite{slatersrules} suggest that, with the screening effect, the \(p_{z}\) electron of a carbon atom should experience a charge of \(Z = 2.4\). To mimic the effect of an electron-screened nucleus, we can use a \(p_{z}\) pseudo-potential. In order to make an educated guess of the parameters of this new potential, we need to find an expression for \(Z_{eff}(\langle r \rangle)\); \(Z_{eff}\) being the total nuclear attraction the electron would feel in the real CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) system, taking into account the screening effect of the core electrons that would be present in an all-electron model; and \( \langle r \rangle \) being the expected distance of the electron from the nucleus.

The analytical form of the \(p_{z}\) orbital for a hydrogen-like atom is \cite{nyu_h_solutions}
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:analyticalpz}
\phi_{210} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{Z_{eff}}{2a_{0}} ^{\frac{5}{2}} re^{-\frac{Z_{eff}r}{2a_{0}}} \cos \theta
\end{equation}
and from this we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:PsirPsi}
\langle \phi_{210} | r | \phi_{210} \rangle = \frac{5a_{0}}{Z_{eff}}
\end{equation}
Next, we need to find a value for \( \langle r \rangle \). We can do this by calculating

\begin{equation}
\langle r \rangle = \langle \psi_{p_{z}} | r | \psi_{p_{z}} \rangle
\label{equation:exp_r}
\end{equation}

where \(\psi_{p_{z}}\) are the molecular orbitals extracted from a reference calculation of CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\). From Equation \ref{equation:exp_r}, we have \( \langle r \rangle \approx 1.8\;a.u.\) and therefore we can see from Equation \ref{equation:PsirPsi} that \(Z_{eff} \approx 3.6\). Even if we shall use the semi-local pseudo-potential definition for the calculations, for a quick evaluation of overlap effects between the basis set and the pseudo-potential, we assume a non-local pseudo-potential definition. We define:
\begin{equation}
S = \langle \psi_{p_{z}} | \chi \rangle
\end{equation}
the overlap between a molecular orbital \(\psi_{p_{z}}\), and \(\chi\), taken from our non-local pseudo-potential definition \cite{huzinaga_effective_1991}
\begin{equation}
\chi = e^{-\alpha r^{2}},\qquad \widehat{p} = Z_{pseudo} | \chi \rangle \langle \chi |
\end{equation}
leading us to
\begin{equation}
\langle \widehat{Z} \rangle = \langle \psi_{p_{z}} | \widehat{Z} | \psi_{p_{z}} \rangle = \langle \psi_{p_{z}} | Z_{pseudo} | \chi \rangle \langle \chi | \psi_{p_{z}} \rangle = Z_{pseudo} S^{2}
\end{equation}
Finally, knowing that our hydrogen-like pseudo-system already contains a charge, \(Z_{nucleus}=1\), which we subtract from the desired \(Z_{eff}\) with which we want to influence our \(p_{z}\) electron, leaving us with
\begin{equation}
Z_{pseudo} = (Z_{eff} - Z_{nucleus})S^{-2}
\end{equation}

We now have the power to choose a \(p_{z}\) pseudo-potential solely based on the Gaussian exponent, and the \(Z_{eff}\) then follows from the above. Clearly, the exponent should be chosen to give us a strong overlap with the molecular orbital we wish to influence. Hence we arrive at a \(p_{z}\)-potential that should be physically meaningful. We chose the exponent in Table \ref{table:p_potentials}, which gave the maximum overlap possible ($\approx$ 0.79).

\subsubsection*{\sffamily \large CH\(_{3}\): obtaining a guess for the \(s\)-potentials}

We aim first at reproducing the values for the CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) radical as given in Table \ref{table:ch3_s_potentials}. 
This reference CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) is created and has its geometry optimised under Hartree-Fock (HF). At first we thought to place the $s$-potentials at the C - H bond distance from the pseudo-carbon ($r_{C - H} = 2.0446$ a.u. in our reference geometry), before realising such potentials would quickly begin to interfere with other atoms once we started building molecules with our pseudo-carbon. Thinking therefore that we would attempt to keep the effects of the $s$-potentials as possible, we chose $d=0.5$ a.u., approximately the shortest atom-atom distance possible in Turbomole before geometry problems are encountered.

The pseudo-system is then set up, erasing the hydrogen atoms, setting the carbon charge \(Z_{nucleus} = 1\) and applying $p$ and $s$ pseudo-potentials,
as well as selecting the correct orbital for the remaining electron.

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Choice of pseudo-potential criteria and Step-by-step extraction} \label{stepbystep}

Previous pseudo-potential methods have made use of different optimisation criteria, based on the pseudo-potentials' intended use. The pseudo-bond method, for example, is intended for use during geometry-optimisation, and uses a series of reference data, including bond lengths and angles, across a training set of different molecules \cite{zhang_pseudobond_1998}. We too must choose some reference criteria for our potentials. Figure~\ref{figure:diagram} helps to explain our choice of criteria for gauging the efficacy of our potentials. Since our aim is to simulate the electronic behaviour of $\pi$ systems, and our reference system is CH$_3^\bullet$, the HOMO energy of CH$_3^{\bullet}$, $\epsilon_{HOMO(CH_3)}$, i.e. the $p_{z}$ orbital energy, is an obvious choice, and should ensure the orbital of the pseudo-system is well-positioned to interact with other chemical moieties.

We would then take our CH$_3^{\bullet}$ pseudo-potentials and create from them a pseudo-ethylene, the smallest $\pi$ system. From this we would be able to see how well our CH$_3^\bullet$ potentials, based on our hypothesis and assumptions in Section \ref{minimalpotguess}, held up. 

In addition to the HOMO energy of the pseudo-ethylene, we decided we would also compare the $\pi-\pi*$ singlet-triplet energy gap, and the 1$^{st}$ ionisation energy. The reproduction of the ionisation potential shows the extent to which the pseudo-system can still behave like the reference system upon losing an electron, whilst the $\Delta_{ST}$ ensures that the first virtual orbitals are well positioned, which is an indicator of the quality of the system for the reproduction of spectroscopic and chemical interactions.

%In order to determine the quality of the pseudo-potentials that we extract, we base our
%reasoning on Figure~\ref{figure:diagram}.
%In a first step, we focus our work on getting guess potentials, which reproduce the
%$p_z$ orbital of an sp$^2$ carbon in the field of surrounding electron pairs.
%We chose the CH$_3^\bullet$ system for that.
%This will provide us with a guess that we will use as a starting point in
%molecular frameworks were this $p_z$ orbital will be involved in $\pi$ bonds.
%Hence the $\epsilon_{HOMO(CH_3)}$ parameter is relevant to the extraction.
%
%In a second time, starting from this guess, we will optimise parameters for the smallest $\pi$
%bonded system, ethylene.
%Thus, as in this molecule more constraint apply to the $\pi$ space, we optimise
%the full set of the pseudo-potentials we have setup in order to reproduce
%$\epsilon_{HOMO}$, IP and $\Delta_{ST}$.
%As shown in Figure~\ref{figure:diagram}, these parameters allow us to fully define the energetical
%bond parameters.
%$\epsilon_{HOMO}$ ensures that the orbital should be energetically well positioned to interact
%with chemical moieties.
%The reproduction of the ionisation potential shows to what extent, the system with pseudo-potentials
%can rearrange when losing one electron.
%Finally, $\Delta_{ST}$ ensures that the first virtual orbitals are well positioned, which is an
%indicator of the quality of the system in the reproduction of spectroscopic and chemical interactions.


\subsubsection*{\sffamily \large Ethylene: final \(s\) and \(p\)-potentials}

Table \ref{table:potential_params} displays the data resulting from the step-by-step extraction described in Section \ref{stepbystep}. The \(p_{z}\) potential is selected using the procedure described, with the exponent chosen to give the maximum possible overlap with the \(p_{z}\) orbital,
and the matching \(Z_{eff}\) coefficient calculated from the exponent and overlap.
The \(s\)-potentials are then optimised once more to give the correct HOMO energy for CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\). We were able to optimise the first set of CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) potentials easily, giving us a HOMO energy exactly matching that of the reference system. 

The next step was to take two pseudo-CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) systems to create a pseudo-ethylene. Now we see, again from Table \ref{table:potential_params} that the HOMO energy of the pseudo-system has an error of nearly 50\%. We also see that our other chosen metrics, the $\Delta_{ST}$ and 1$^{st}$ ionisation energy, suffer from even greater errors. We are forced to conclude that the assumptions made earlier in Section \ref{minimalpotguess}, that the $p_{z}$ orbital shape of CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) might not serve well for $C_{2}H_{4}$. This being the case, there is no reason to believe that our $Z_{eff}$ estimate, obtained from Equation \ref{equation:analyticalpz} is correct, and so our attempt at an analytical solution is no use for modelling the $\pi$ systems in which we are interested. Once we abandoned the constraints our theoretical solution placed on the potential parameters, and permitted the optimising code to find an entirely empirical solution, we were able to extract a final potential set, the results of which can be seen in Table \ref{table:potential_params}. These potentials are much better than the previous efforts, giving us a 0\% error on the $\Delta_{ST}$, and errors of 2.9\% and 7.8\% for the HOMO and 1$^{st}$ ionisation energies respectively.

In the final version of the extraction, the pseudo-ethylene system was optimised from several different random starting guesses to give the correct $\Delta_{ST}$ value, and the one that also gave the best HOMO and 1$^{st}$ ionisation energies chosen as the starting guess for a final optimisation, performed by hand, to give us the final set of pseudo-potentials used in the rest of this work.

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Applications}

\subsubsection*{\sffamily \large C\(\mathbf{_{2n}}\)H\(\mathbf{_{2n+2}}\), \(\mathbf{2 \leq n \leq 12}\)}

Taking these new potentials we test them against a series of chain alkenes up to length C\(_{12}\)H\(_{14}\), using a variety of functionals. In each case, the geometry of the reference system is optimised according to the method used, 
before taking the reference geometry and applying the pseudo-potentials from Table \ref{table:ethene_excitations}. 
Figures \ref{fig:alkenes_hf_dft} and \ref{fig:alkenes_tddft} show the results. Table \ref{table:alkene_errors} gives a breakdown of the percentage errors for each method across all molecules tested. The pattern of increasing HOMO energy and decreasing cation-singlet and triplet-singlet energies seen in the reference systems is well replicated by the pseudo-alkenes, with the energies following the same gradient.

We also compare TD-DFT results for this system and results of a previous work of some of the authors, which match to within 3\%.\cite{drujon_pseudopotentials_2013}
Let us recall here that in our previous work potentials were placed at the center of bonds.

\subsubsection*{\sffamily \large Large Systems}

The potentials derived above are also tested on larger systems.
Figure \ref{fig:rings_graphs} shows the $\Delta_{ST}$, the IE and
HOMO energy values for several ring systems.
As with the short chain alkenes, the general trend of the results is well-replicated
by the pseudo-systems, and the percentage errors, displayed in Table
\ref{table:ring_system_errors}, are similar.

Figure~\ref{fig:long_chain_graphs} and Table \ref{table:long_alkene_errors} refer to longer 
alkene chains (\(n\) up to 100).
The pattern of decreasing ionisation potentials and $\Delta_{ST}$ with increasing HOMO
energy is still followed, with the absolute error remaining consistent.
However, differences in the triplet-singlet energies between the reference and pseudo-systems 
become significant, notably for the largest case.

Unlike for the previous systems, there is a large discrepancy between $\Delta_{ST}$
and TD-DFT results.
This apparent failure of the pseudo-potentials is to be found in the representation
of the triplet state. The expectation values of the $S^2$ operator for the triplet calculations
are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssquare}, which shows that the spin contamination
of the triplet state computed as a single configuration (\emph{i.e.} in a SCF
framework) increases in both reference and pseudo-potential cases.
Yet, this effect is strengthened in the pseudo-potential calculations.
These results suggest that the triplet state cannot be represented as one configuration
but as a linear combination of mono-electronic excitations as done through TD-DFT.

In order to show that the recovering of the agreement between the pseudo-potential
and the reference calculations is not an artefact, we give in Table~\ref{tab:coef}
the weight and nature of each excitation (weight larger than 3\%)
in the description of the triplet excited state for
C$_{50}$H$_{52}$ (other values can be found in the SI, which exhibit the same trends).
As can be seen, the agreement is very good. 

The previous calculations show that the pseudo-potentials that we have extracted
are able to reproduce the low-lying first excited state as well as the ionisation potential
of a large range of polycyclic hydrocarbons.
We could even show that the virtual space was reproduced properly.
To do so, we compute a large number of $\pi$ excited states and compare
our results to reference calculations with the PBE0 functional.
As can be seen from Figure~\ref{cnhn_uv}, the excitation energies as well as the
intensities of the excitations computed by TD-DFT are in extremely good agreement.

These results show that the pseudo-potentials that we have extracted are able to reproduce the
$\pi$ systems in a variety of situations which are not part of their extraction set.
The molecular orbital virtual space is also well described (cf. Table~\ref{tab:coef}),
which demonstrates that the good agreement with reference calculations is
physically grounded.

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Computational Details}

All Hartree-Fock, DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) energy calculations are performed with TURBOMOLE 7.1 \cite{TURBOMOLE}. The basis set used throughout is def-SV(P) \cite{defsvp}. Wherever possible, planar (C\(_{S}\)) symmetry is used. The convergence energy is \(10^{-7}\)H (\texttt{\$scfconv = 7}) for SCF and \(10^{-6}\)H for DFT. When running these calculations the occupation of orbitals is specified manually in the TURBOMOLE control file.

\textbf{Chain Alkenes, Ring Molecules}. In additional to Hartree-Fock calculations, DFT is used with PBE0, PBE, TPSS and TPSSh functionals. \cite{pbe0,pbe,tpss,tpssh} The integration grid size is set at \(m4\). Also used are TD-DFT calculations, where the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (CIS) \cite{tammdancoff} is switched on to avoid triplet instability.

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Optimisation}

\subsubsection*{Procedure}

In the beginning, $s$ and $p$ potentials were extracted for the CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) system. The $p$ potentials were set using the procedure described in Section \ref{minimalpotguess}, while the $s$ potentials were optimised by choosing a series of exponents and attempting for each to optimise a coefficient that would result int he system having the correct reference HOMO energy.

 Later optimisations were performed on the ethylene system directly. Both $s$ and $p$ potentials were extracted empirically, and without the theoretical constraints imposed on the CH\(^{\bullet}_{3}\) system. With the different potential variables available, we produced a range of optimised potential sets. The best set of these potentials was then chosen and the values altered by hand in order to match as closely as possible three separate reference values: the singlet HOMO energy, the singlet-triplet \(\pi-\pi*\) excitation energy, and the cation-singlet energy. All optimisations used the Brent method in SciPy's optimisation library, with a tolerance of \(1.48*10^{-08}\), and used standard Hartree-Fock calculations.\cite{scipy}

\section*{\sffamily \Large CONCLUSION}

In this paper pseudo-potentials have been developed for sp$^{2}$-hybridised carbon units containing only one nuclear charge and one electron. Their main features are that: (1) They are fully atomic, meaning that they can be placed relative only to the carbon atom itself and the direction of its bonds. (2) They are able to reproduce basic electronic properties including HOMO, 1$^{st}$ ionisation and singlet-triplet gap energies, as well as reproduce physically reasonable emission spectra (3) They can be employed with both Hartree-Fock and DFT methods including PBE0, PBE, TPSS and TPSSh functionals. (4) They have been shown to function well whether the sp$^{2}$ bonds would be to another pseudo-carbon or to a hydrogen atom. (5) They offer a significant gain in computational time as compared to all-electron calculations.

We could show that not only were the occupied orbitals well-reproduced by the use of these new potentials, but also that the virtual space is of good quality
for excited states calculation. The logical next steps are the addition of an explicit ``no collapse" term, the reproduction of the gradient through the parameterisation of additional terms. The first step is needed in order to avoid forcing the molecular orbital occupation and to avoid spurious virtual orbitals in the active space. We are confident that the first step could be easily done, as we have already extracted such terms in the previous version of our potentials. The reproduction of the gradient is more of a challenge, given the number of electrons removed from the system.

Potential uses for such potentials include: (1) As link atoms in QM/MM calculations, as a replacement for hydrogen capping. (2) A general method for increasing computational efficency in large systems in which there are many sp$^{2}$ carbon units, both in SCF calculations and the generation of emission spectra. This could be particularly useful in large molecules which are optically active.
