The GHO method provides a well-defined potential energy surface for a hybrid QM/MM system and is a significant improvement over the “link-atom” approach by saturating the QM valencies with hydrogen atoms. The method has been tested on small molecules and yields reasonable structural, energetic, and electronic results in comparison with the results of the corresponding QM and MM approximations. The GHO method will greatly increase the applicability of combined QM/MM methods to systems comprising large molecules, such as proteins.},

To this end, we calibrate DCACP’s in order to reproduce the equilibrium distance and binding energy of MP2 potential energy surfaces of the weakly bonded homodimers Ar2, Kr2, and (Br2)2. In all cases studied, using DFT with the generalized gradient approximation functional BLYP and the DCACP’s, the influence of dispersion forces on equilibrium and transition-state geometries, interaction energies, and transition barriers can be reproduced in good agreement with MP2 calculations and without any significant increase in computational cost. The transferability of the DCACP’s to other systems is assessed by addressing various weakly bonded complexes. We investigate (i) ideal van der Waals clusters of the type ArnKrm (∀n,m=\{0,1,2,3,4\} and 2⩽n+m⩽4), (ii) the effect of DCACP’s on covalent bonds and conformers of the hydrocarbon molecule cyclooctatetraene which features a system of π bonds, and (iii) the competition of simultaneous electrostatic and dispersion forces for the equilibrium structure and transition states of the hydrogen bromide dimer (HBr)2. In all cases, the performance of the DCACP’s to these extended set of systems is remarkably good.},

        abstract = {We present pseudopotential coefficients for the first two rows of the Periodic Table. The pseudopotential is of an analytic form that gives optimal efficiency in numerical calculations using plane waves as a basis set. At most, seven coefficients are necessary to specify its analytic form. It is separable and has optimal decay properties in both real and Fourier space. Because of this property, the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system. We systematically verify the high accuracy of these pseudopotentials by extensive atomic and molecular test calculations. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

This is mostly due to the fact that it is fairly convenient to implement and parametrize, thus providing an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational effort. In this work, a viable and straight-forward approach to optimize the placing of the link atom on a suitable distance ratio between the frontier atoms is discussed. To further increase the accuracy, instead of global parameters for all amino acids, different parameter sets for each type of amino acid are derived. The dependency of the link bond parameters on the chemical environment and the used QM-method is probed to assess the range of applicability of the parametrization. Suitable sets of parameters for RI-MP2, B3LYP, (RI)-B3LYP-D3, and RI-BLYP-D3 at triple-zeta level for all relevant proteinogenic amino acids are presented. Furthermore, the scope and range of the perturbation, stemming from the introduction of link bonds is evaluated through application of the presented QM/MM scheme in calculations of the active site of 15S-lipoxygenase.

The open boundary is characterised by on-the-fly exchanges of partial charges and atoms between the QM and MM subsystems, allowing us to focus on the small QM subsystem of primary interest in dynamics simulations. An open-boundary scheme has the promise to the utilisations of small QM subsystems, high-levels of QM theory and long simulation times, which can potentially lead to new insights.},

To overcome this problem we show that one can use empirical force correcting atom centred potentials (FCACPs), parametrised for every nuclear species. Parameters are obtained through minimisation of a penalty functional that explicitly encodes hybrid DFT forces and static polarisabilities of reference molecules. For hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine and carbon the respective reference molecules consist of H-2, F-2, Cl-2 and CH4. The transferability of this approach is assessed for harmonic frequencies in a small set of chlorofluorocarbon molecules. Numerical evidence, gathered for CF4, CCl4, CCl3F, CCl2F2, CClF3, ClF, HF, HCl, CFH3, CF2H2, CF3H, CHCl3, CH2Cl2 and CH3Cl indicates that the GGA+FCACP level of theory yields harmonic frequencies that are significantly more consistent with hybrid DFT values, as well as slightly reduced molecular polarisability.},

The applicability of this EDF library is demonstrated by the analyses of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and other real space functions on HeCuF, , OgF4, and TlCl3(DMSO)2. When a large-core ECP is used, it shows that the corrections by EDF may significantly improve the properties of some density-derived real space functions, but they are invalid for the wavefunction-depending real space functions. To classify different chemical bonds and especially some nonclassical interactions, a list of universal criteria has also been proposed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The polyacenes and cyclacenes have geometries consisting of two fully delocalized nonalternating ribbons joined by relatively long bonds.

The fully delocalized nonalternating nature of polyacenes differs from the bond alternation resulting from Peierls distortion in polyenes.

Since all of these PAH wavefunctions exhibit large unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) instabilities, the C14H10 PAHs were also studied using higher levels of electron correlation. Additionally, the role of UHF instabilities was investigated for the the linear conjugated polyenes from C2H4 to C20H22.

For physically realistic parameter sets the SDW ground state of the infinite linear equidistant polyene has been shown to be lowest in energy. Whereas the symmetry-adapted restricted HF (RHF) solution (SAS) has been shown to be unstable to the formation of SDW's and SBAW's for all investigated parametrizations, the bond-order alternation wave (BAW) solution has been found to be unstable to the formation of SDW's, but stable to the formation of SBAW's; in fact, the BAW's and the SBAW's have been shown to yield identical gap widths and ground-state energies (at least in the PPP method). It has been shown that there exist such sets of semiempirical parameters for which the charge-density wave (CDW) ground state is nonsinglet stable irrespective of the existence of an energetically advantageous SDW solution for the same parameter set.},

Our focus was put on determining the nature of the two lowest-lying singlet excited states, 11Bu+ and 21Ag−, and their ordering. The 11Bu+ state is a singly excited state with an ionic nature originating from the HOMO→LUMO one-electron transition while the covalent 21Ag− state is the doubly excited state which comes mainly from the (HOMO)2→(LUMO)2 transition. The active-space and basis-set effects are taken into account to estimate the excitation energies of larger polyenes. For butadiene, the 11Bu+ state is calculated to be slightly lower by 0.1 eV than the doubly excited 21Ag− state at the ground-state equilibrium geometry. For hexatriene, our calculations predict the two states to be virtually degenerate. Octatetraene is the first polyene for which we predict that the 21Ag− state is the lowest excited singlet state at the ground-state geometry. The present theory also indicates that the 21Ag− state lies clearly below the 11Bu+ state in decapentaene with the energy gap of 0.4 eV. The 0–0 transition and the emission energies are also calculated using the planar C2h relaxed excited-state geometries. The covalent 21Ag− state is much more sensitive to the geometry variation than is the ionic 11Bu+ state, which places the 21Ag− state significantly below the 11Bu+ state at the relaxed geometry. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
