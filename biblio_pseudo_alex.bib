In this method, a set of hybrid orbitals is placed on the boundary atom between the QM and MM fragments, and one of the hybrid orbitals participates in the SCF calculation for the atoms in the QM region. The GHO method provides a well-defined potential energy surface for a hybrid QM/MM system and is a significant improvement over the “link-atom” approach by saturating the QM valencies with hydrogen atoms. The method has been tested on small molecules and yields reasonable structural, energetic, and electronic results in comparison with the results of the corresponding QM and MM approximations. The GHO method will greatly increase the applicability of combined QM/MM methods to systems comprising large molecules, such as proteins.},

The molecular orbitals of this subsystem are developed on a basis of functions, orthogonal to the localized orbitals, which derive from the atomic orbitals of the usual basis set by a simple linear transformation.

Rev. Lett. 93, 153004 (2004); J. Chem. Phys. 122, 014113 (2005)]. In this study, we investigate a small library of dispersion-corrected atom-centered potentials (DCACP’s) for C, Ar, Kr, and Br. To this end, we calibrate DCACP’s in order to reproduce the equilibrium distance and binding energy of MP2 potential energy surfaces of the weakly bonded homodimers Ar2, Kr2, and (Br2)2. In all cases studied, using DFT with the generalized gradient approximation functional BLYP and the DCACP’s, the influence of dispersion forces on equilibrium and transition-state geometries, interaction energies, and transition barriers can be reproduced in good agreement with MP2 calculations and without any significant increase in computational cost. The transferability of the DCACP’s to other systems is assessed by addressing various weakly bonded complexes. We investigate (i) ideal van der Waals clusters of the type ArnKrm (∀n,m=\{0,1,2,3,4\} and 2⩽n+m⩽4), (ii) the effect of DCACP’s on covalent bonds and conformers of the hydrocarbon molecule cyclooctatetraene which features a system of π bonds, and (iii) the competition of simultaneous electrostatic and dispersion forces for the equilibrium structure and transition states of the hydrogen bromide dimer (HBr)2. In all cases, the performance of the DCACP’s to these extended set of systems is remarkably good.},

	abstract = {We present pseudopotential coefficients for the first two rows of the Periodic Table. The pseudopotential is of an analytic form that gives optimal efficiency in numerical calculations using plane waves as a basis set. At most, seven coefficients are necessary to specify its analytic form. It is separable and has optimal decay properties in both real and Fourier space. Because of this property, the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system. We systematically verify the high accuracy of these pseudopotentials by extensive atomic and molecular test calculations. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

This allows us to construct this type of pseudopotential for the whole Periodic Table, and we present a complete table of pseudopotential parameters for all the elements from H to Rn. The relativistic version of this pseudopotential retains all the advantages of its nonrelativistic version. It is separable by construction, it is optimal for integration on a real-space grid, it is highly accurate, and, due to its analytic form, it can be specified by a very small number of parameters. The accuracy of the pseudopotential is illustrated by an extensive series of molecular calculations.},

	abstract = {The hydrogen-capping method is one of the most popular and widely used coupling-schemes for quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)-molecular dynamics simulations of macromolecular systems. This is mostly due to the fact that it is fairly convenient to implement and parametrize, thus providing an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational effort. In this work, a viable and straight-forward approach to optimize the placing of the link atom on a suitable distance ratio between the frontier atoms is discussed. To further increase the accuracy, instead of global parameters for all amino acids, different parameter sets for each type of amino acid are derived. The dependency of the link bond parameters on the chemical environment and the used QM-method is probed to assess the range of applicability of the parametrization. Suitable sets of parameters for RI-MP2, B3LYP, (RI)-B3LYP-D3, and RI-BLYP-D3 at triple-zeta level for all relevant proteinogenic amino acids are presented. Furthermore, the scope and range of the perturbation, stemming from the introduction of link bonds is evaluated through application of the presented QM/MM scheme in calculations of the active site of 15S-lipoxygenase.

The open boundary is characterised by on-the-fly exchanges of partial charges and atoms between the QM and MM subsystems, allowing us to focus on the small QM subsystem of primary interest in dynamics simulations. An open-boundary scheme has the promise to the utilisations of small QM subsystems, high-levels of QM theory and long simulation times, which can potentially lead to new insights.},

	abstract = {Generalised gradient approximated (GGA) density functional theory (DFT) typically overestimates polarisability and bond-lengths, and underestimates force constants of covalent bonds. To overcome this problem we show that one can use empirical force correcting atom centred potentials (FCACPs), parametrised for every nuclear species. Parameters are obtained through minimisation of a penalty functional that explicitly encodes hybrid DFT forces and static polarisabilities of reference molecules. For hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine and carbon the respective reference molecules consist of H-2, F-2, Cl-2 and CH4. The transferability of this approach is assessed for harmonic frequencies in a small set of chlorofluorocarbon molecules. Numerical evidence, gathered for CF4, CCl4, CCl3F, CCl2F2, CClF3, ClF, HF, HCl, CFH3, CF2H2, CF3H, CHCl3, CH2Cl2 and CH3Cl indicates that the GGA+FCACP level of theory yields harmonic frequencies that are significantly more consistent with hybrid DFT values, as well as slightly reduced molecular polarisability.},
